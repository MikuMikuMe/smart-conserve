To create a Python program for a project like smart-conserve, we'll need to break down the requirements into several parts: data collection, analysis, real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and recommendations. For the sake of this example, I'll use mock data to simulate household energy usage. The program will use this data to provide insights and suggest ways to conserve energy. I'll also include comments and error handling for clarity and robustness.

```python
import random
import statistics
import logging
from typing import List, Dict

# Set up logging for error handling
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Mock data: Simulate household energy usage over a period (hourly usage for a week)
def generate_mock_data() -> List[float]:
    """Generate mock data for energy usage in watts."""
    try:
        # Simulating data for 24 hours a day for 7 days
        data = [random.uniform(200, 1000) for _ in range(24 * 7)]
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error generating mock data: {e}")
        return []

def analyze_energy_usage(data: List[float]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Analyze energy usage data and return insights."""
    try:
        # Calculate basic statistics
        average_usage = statistics.mean(data)
        max_usage = max(data)
        min_usage = min(data)

        insights = {
            "average_usage": average_usage,
            "max_usage": max_usage,
            "min_usage": min_usage,
        }
        return insights
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error analyzing energy usage: {e}")
        return {}

def provide_recommendations(average_usage: float) -> List[str]:
    """Provide energy conservation recommendations based on average usage."""
    recommendations = []
    try:
        if average_usage > 750:
            recommendations.append("Consider using energy-efficient appliances.")
            recommendations.append("Check insulation in your home to reduce heating/cooling costs.")
        elif 500 < average_usage <= 750:
            recommendations.append("Unplug devices when not in use.")
            recommendations.append("Use programmable thermostats to reduce energy consumption.")
        else:
            recommendations.append("You're doing great! Continue monitoring for further improvements.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error providing recommendations: {e}")
    return recommendations

def run_smart_conserve():
    """Main function to run the smart-conserve application."""
    try:
        # Generate mock data simulating real-time monitoring
        energy_data = generate_mock_data()
        if not energy_data:
            raise ValueError("No energy data available.")

        # Analyze the energy usage data
        insights = analyze_energy_usage(energy_data)
        if not insights:
            raise ValueError("Could not analyze energy data.")

        # Log insights
        logging.info(f"Energy Usage Insights: {insights}")

        # Provide recommendations based on insights
        recommendations = provide_recommendations(insights["average_usage"])

        logging.info("Energy Conservation Recommendations:")
        for rec in recommendations:
            logging.info(f"- {rec}")

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error running smart-conserve: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_smart_conserve()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Logging:** We use the `logging` module for error handling and insightful messages.
2. **Data Generation:** The `generate_mock_data` function creates a list of random numbers representing energy usage in watts for each hour over a week.
3. **Data Analysis:** The `analyze_energy_usage` function calculates the average, maximum, and minimum usage. It returns a dictionary of these insights.
4. **Recommendations:** The `provide_recommendations` function gives energy-saving tips based on the average usage.
5. **Main Function:** The `run_smart_conserve` function orchestrates data generation, analysis, and recommendation providing. It uses exception handling to manage potential errors.

This is a simplified version of what such an application might look like. Real-time monitoring and predictive analytics would involve more sophisticated data collection and processing, potentially using APIs or IoT devices for real-time data.
